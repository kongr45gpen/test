BZFlag plugins that give players a flag on spawn depending on a variable

Usage
-----

The flagOnSpawn plugin is very easy to use. After you load it (it doesn't require any parameters), set the variable _flagonspawn according to your preferences.

Possible values:
* `none`: Give no flag on spawn, does the same as if the plugin wasn't loaded
* `random`: Gives a random flag on spawn, making a choice amongst the available ones
* Any flag name (e.g. `WG`): Gives the specified flag on spawn

Note that if you want to set this variable on your config file, do so this way:

    -setforced _flagonspawn value

Installation by compilation on Linux
------------------------------------

1. Go to the plugins directory and run `git clone git://github.com/kongr45gpen/flagOnSpawn.git`
2. Edit the Makefile.am and add a line for the flagOnSpawn folder, and do the same to ../configure.ac
3. On the base bzflag source folder, run:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --disable-client
    make
    sudo make install

4. Add `-loadplugin flagOnSpawn` to your server configuration file.

I am a robot
------------

Maybe you want to print `robot` to the console 1000 times. Why not?

    def robot_invasion
      puts("robot " * 1000)
    end

You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.

How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?
